# CPSC 6030 - Data Visualization 

# Visualization of Misconduct in New York City Police Department

The project represented on this platform fleshes out a story of visualizations on a lucrative topic which revolves around the allegations filed by the civilians in the city of New York against the NYPD. The aim of this project is to visualize and get best possible insights on the allegation patterns with respect to ethnicities of the police officers and the complainants. The dataset which we obtained is majorly on the allegations filed against the department with respect to the different precincts. 

We represent three types of visualizations:

1) Line graph.
2) Geographical Map.
3) Sankey Graph.

This Project was developed by a team of three individuals: Pranav Kalbhor, Akshay Deshpande, Chaitanya Mundle.
